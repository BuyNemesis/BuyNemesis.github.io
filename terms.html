        <h2>License Grant and Restrictions</h2>
        <p>Upon purchase, we grant you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the software for personal or commercial purposes, as specified during the purchase process. You may not:</p>

            <li>Engaging in actions that are deemed detrimental to the integrity of our product, servers, or community.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your license is blacklisted or revoked, you will lose access to the software, and no refunds will be issued.</p>

        <h2>Communication Servers and Community Guidelines</h2>

        <p>We provide updates and support for the software during the period specified in the purchase agreement. These updates may include bug fixes, security patches, and new features.

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the software and services at any time, without prior notice, if we determine, at our sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms. Upon termination, your license to use the software will be revoked, and you must immediately cease using the software.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Nemesis will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of revenue, or loss of use, arising out of your use of the software or services. This includes, but is not limited to, any issues caused by the use of our software in third-party applications, such as video games, or any potential damage to your computer or data.</p>

        <h2>No Responsibility for Bans or Computer Damage</h2>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nemesis is not responsible for any bans or other penalties you may incur in video games or online platforms while using our software. This includes, but is not limited to, account bans, suspensions, or any other actions taken by the game developer or platform owner.</li>
            <li>We are not liable for any damage to your computer, operating system, or any other hardware or software arising from the use of our product. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security and integrity of your system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Nemesis, its affiliates, and employees from any claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses arising from your use of the software, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the updated terms will be effective immediately upon posting. By continuing to use the software after such changes, you agree to abide by the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
